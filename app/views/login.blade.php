<h2>Log in to Ezrahub to skip solving captchas:</h2>
<p>Logging in to Ezra Hub will allow you to skip solving captchas for every single post. Ezra Hub will:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>never</b> attach your name or anything personal to any of your posts</li>
	<li><b>never</b> post or share things on your wall</li>
	<li><b>never</b> access your friends list or any of your information</li>
	<li><b>never</b> send alpha messages to 9/10 HBBs on Facebook chat and get you laid</li>
	<li><b>never</b> share anything about you anywhere on this site</li>
</ul>
<p>The only function is to validate simply and easily that you are not a robot allowing you to skip the captcha. If you're really paranoid about this, check Ezra Hub's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wnajar/ezrahub-v3/blob/master/app/controllers/UserController.php">source code</a> and confirm for yourself.</p>
